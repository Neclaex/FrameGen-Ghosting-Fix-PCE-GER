# FrameGen-Ghosting-Fix-PCE-GER
This is a translation for the [FrameGen Ghosting 'Fix' for FSR3 FG Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/13029) mod by [gramern](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/gramern/about-me) from English to German.

This is an unofficial, imperfect translation and is for the FrameGen Ghosting Fix Preem Compatibility Edition v. **4.8.2xl**.



To install, simply Download the Zip from the [Nexus Mod Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/15367?tab=files) and unzip the folder in your Cyberpunk folder, as you did with most other mods.

Unfortunately, the `UIText.lua` alone is not enough for a complete translation, as some sentences/words are in other files. If you want to check that nothing has changed except the language, you can find the original repo here: [gramern/cp77-ghosting-fix](https://github.com/gramern/cp77-ghosting-fix/tree/main-xl/resources/bin/x64/plugins/cyber_engine_tweaks/mods/FrameGenGhostingFix).


The credits for the mod do not belong to me, as I only translated a few things. You can find out who the credits go to besides gramern on the official [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/13029?tab=description).
