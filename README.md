This is a translation for the [FrameGen Ghosting 'Fix' for FSR3 FG Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/13029) mod by [gramern](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/gramern/about-me) from English to German.

This is an unofficial, imperfect translation and is for any FrameGen Ghosting Fix Edition above version **unknown**.



To install, simply Download the Zip from the [Nexus Mod Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/15367?tab=files) and unzip the folder in your Cyberpunk folder, as you did with most other mods.


The credits for the mod do not belong to me, as I only translated a few things. You can find out who the credits go to besides [gramern](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/gramern/about-me) on the official [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/13029?tab=description).
